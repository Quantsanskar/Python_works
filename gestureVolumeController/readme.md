This is the gesture volume controller made by me by using python's libraries.

Just Install my source code and run on your machine after installing all the essential modules like 

cv2, mediapipe, pycaw, numpy in your cmd by using command:- pip install {module name}

if you don't find cv2 then install cv and then upgrade it by using this command:- pip install --upgrade opencv-python

Control the volume of your device by running this code in your machine with your fingers' gestures.

Thank You
